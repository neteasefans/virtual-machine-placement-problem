The benchmark instances used in our draft titled with "An iterated local search for virtual machine placement problem" were friendly provided in the PACO-VMP literature [refer to [3]]. The source code of the proposed ILS algorithm will be made available upon the publication of the paper.

The optimal solution certificates are given in 'solutions' directory.
